FoundationApp
=======================

Introduction
------------
Identify the elements which are common to all modern web applications and bring them together to form a foundational core.

The core will act as a launch pad for speedily building new applications, meaning that development time is focused on bespoke functionality, rather than reinventing the wheel.

The core can be continually maintained and version controlled, and apps built on the core can upgraded with latest enhancements.

Modular, minimal dependencies: Each core element can be turned on or off without impacting the the others.  An element could be swapped out and replaced by another element if needed.

The following elements will be considered:

Essential
------------
User
RBAC
Notifications
Admin Control Panel

Optional:
------------
CMS Support
Oauth Support
Private Messaging
User Content Creation
User Commenting
